**John wick**
# A grieving John Wick, a retired hitman, seeks brutal vengeance when a young gangster steals his car and kills his beloved puppy, the last gift from his deceased wife. Unleashing his unparalleled skills, John tears through the New York City underworld, facing off against waves of thugs and assassins in a relentless, stylishly choreographed ballet of bullets and bone-crunching action. Driven by grief and rage, he'll stop at nothing until he lays waste to everyone who took everything he had left.


**Spiderman No way Home**
# Spell goes wrong, bad guys from other universes show up, Spidey saves the day (and the multiverse!).
